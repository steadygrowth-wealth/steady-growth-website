  <!-- =============== CATEGORY 1: GETTING STARTED =============== -->
  <h2 class="faq-category-title" style="margin-top:35px;">Getting Started</h2>

  <div class="faq-list">

    <details>
      <summary>1. What exactly does a Mutual Fund Distributor do?</summary>
      <p>A Mutual Fund Distributor helps investors select suitable mutual fund schemes by
      understanding their goals, risk profile, and investment timeline. They also assist with
      onboarding, paperwork, KYC, transaction execution, portfolio review & continued guidance
      without providing stock tips or guaranteed returns.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. Who can invest in mutual funds?</summary>
      <p>Almost anyone—salaried professionals, entrepreneurs, homemakers, students above 18,
      NRIs, HUFs, trusts and companies can invest, provided they meet KYC and compliance norms.
      Minors can also invest under guardian mode.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Do I need a demat account to invest?</summary>
      <p>No, a demat account is not mandatory. Units can be held in statement mode through
      NJ Wealth or respective AMCs. However, investors may choose demat mode if they prefer all
      assets consolidated under one demat account.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. Can I start investing with small amounts?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) can start from as low as ₹500 per month in many
      mutual fund schemes, making it suitable for first-time and young investors.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. I’m completely new to investing. Is this suitable for beginners?</summary>
      <p>Absolutely. Mutual funds are professionally managed and designed for long-term wealth
      creation. Beginners often find them simpler than trading or direct equity, as risks are
      diversified and decisions are guided by SEBI-regulated fund managers.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. Can I pause or stop my SIP anytime?</summary>
      <p>Yes, SIPs are flexible. You can modify, pause or stop them whenever required without
      penalty, subject to AMC terms.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. Will mutual fund investments protect me from market losses?</summary>
      <p>No investment offering market-linked returns is risk-free. However, proper asset
      allocation, diversification, and long-term holding greatly reduce volatility-related
      risks.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. How long should I stay invested?</summary>
      <p>There is no fixed duration. Ideally, equity investments require a 5–10+ year horizon
      for meaningful wealth creation, whereas debt funds may suit short-term goals.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. Can I invest jointly with a family member?</summary>
      <p>Yes, joint holding is allowed with up to three holders based on nomination, mode,
      and compliance rules.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. Will you help me decide which scheme to invest in?</summary>
      <p>Yes. Scheme suitability is assessed after analyzing your goals, risk level, horizon,
      liquidity requirements and existing portfolio to avoid overlap and excessive risk.</p>
    </details>
  </div>



  <!-- =============== CATEGORY 2: PROCESS & DOCUMENTS =============== -->
  <h2 class="faq-category-title" style="margin-top:35px;">Process & Documents</h2>

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. What is CKYC and why is it mandatory?</summary>
      <p>Central KYC is a government-regulated identity verification system that eliminates
      repeated KYC submissions across financial institutions. It ensures compliance & prevents
      identity misuse.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. How long does the onboarding process take?</summary>
      <p>If all documents are correct, most investors are onboarded digitally within 10–30
      minutes. Manual verification may take up to 24–48 hours.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. Can I invest fully online?</summary>
      <p>Yes. From KYC to SIP setup, every step is paperless and can be completed via mobile,

    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. What if my CKYC is rejected or pending?</summary>
      <p>We assist you with corrections such as signature mismatch, address update, name change
      etc. Re-KYC may be required if old KYC is non-compliant.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. Can minors invest?</summary>
      <p>Yes, via a guardian until age 18. When attaining majority, KYC & bank change is required.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. How will I receive reports?</summary>

    </details>
  </div>



  <!-- =============== CATEGORY 3: RISK & RETURNS =============== -->
  <h2 class="faq-category-title" style="margin-top:35px;">Risk & Returns</h2>

  <div class="faq-list">

    <details>
      <summary>1. Are mutual funds safe?</summary>
      <p>There are low-risk, medium-risk and high-risk funds. Safety depends on fund category,
      market conditions and holding period, not just brand or AMC size.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>2. What returns should I expect?</summary>
      <p>No guaranteed returns. Historically, equity funds have delivered 10–15% CAGR over
      long periods, while debt and hybrid funds deliver lower but stable returns.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>3. Why does NAV fluctuate?</summary>
      <p>NAV reflects the real-time market value of the fund’s underlying securities such as
      stocks, bonds and cash holdings — hence it moves daily.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>4. What if the market crashes?</summary>
      <p>A market fall is temporary in most economic cycles. The key is portfolio allocation
      and discipline, not timing. Down cycles often become favourable entry points.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>5. Can I lose money permanently?</summary>
      <p>Permanent loss generally happens only if you exit in panic or choose unsuitable
      schemes. Staying invested long term with proper allocation reduces such risks.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>6. Are mutual funds better than FDs?</summary>
      <p>FDs offer capital safety and fixed return, while mutual funds offer potentially higher
      inflation-beating returns with market risk. Most investors need a mix, not either/or.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>7. Should I withdraw profits regularly?</summary>
      <p>Profit booking too frequently may affect long-term compounding. Withdraw only if
      goal-based or based on rebalancing decisions.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>8. Which funds are safest?</summary>
      <p>Ultra-short, liquid and certain debt funds have low volatility, but even they are not
      100% risk-free. Category choice must match goal timeline.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>9. What is exit load?</summary>
      <p>A small fee charged if you withdraw before the minimum holding period as defined by the
      scheme. It encourages investment discipline.</p>
    </details>

    <details>
      <summary>10. How do I control risk?</summary>
      <p>Diversification, appropriate allocation, review frequency, long holding period,
      and avoiding emotional decisions.</p>
    </details>
  </div>

      <p>No. While long durations improve outcome probability, returns depend on market
